XULA nginx wordpress cookbook

This is a wrapper cookbook I'm creating to expidite our deployment of our wordpress server(s). We currently are not extensively using WP, however it appears that in the near future we will and I would like the ability to rapidly deploy and configure them. 

This cookbook requires you to already have an external MariaDB server configured and able to accept remote connections and a GlusterFS target for the files served by WP.
